### What I learned
I learnt how to adjust background in CSS.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
background: url('../images/bg-pattern-top.svg') right 50vw bottom no-repeat, url('../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg') 50vw 50vh no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development
I will continue this journey.

### Useful resources

- [Kumbh Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumbh+Sans) - This helped me for font-style. I really liked this font and will use it going forward.
